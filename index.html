    <p>Been thinking 'bout you baby
        And I don't know what to do
        All I think about is you
        Seems everything around me
        Things I've never understood
        They all make sense when I'm with you.
        Oh, I've heard it all before
        Finding so called love then you leave it behind
        But now I feel so sure
        I listen to my heart this time
        So I lay it on the line
        I know that what I've found is once in a lifetime
        And I know there's no way out
        'Cause it's once in a lifetime
        I've always been so lonely
        No one there for me to hold
        And every night was just so cold
        Oh don't get me wrong I've been around
        But I've resigned myself to thinking
        Mine is just another story often told
        Oh, I've heard it all before
        Finding so called love then you leave it behind
        But now I feel so sure
        I listen to my heart this time
        Put my heart before my mind
        I know that what I've found is once in a lifetime
        And I know there's no way out
        'Cause it's once in a lifetime
        It's not like I'm running out of time
        I'm taking everything in stride
        It's just I never thought I'd find
        What would make me change my mind
        I know that what I've found is once in a lifetime, yeah
        And I know there's no way out
        'Cause it's once in a lifetime
